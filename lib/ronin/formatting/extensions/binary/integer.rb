  #
  # Extracts a sequence of bytes which represent the Integer.
  #
  # @param [Integer] address_length
  #   The number of bytes to decode from the Integer.
  #
  # @param [Symbol] endian
  #   The endianness to use while decoding the bytes of the Integer.
  #   May be either `:big`, `:little` or `:net`.
  #
  # @return [Array]
  #   The bytes decoded from the Integer.
  #
  # @example
  #   0xff41.bytes(2)
  #   # => [65, 255]
  #
  # @example
  #   0xff41.bytes(4, :big)
  #   # => [0, 0, 255, 65]

  # Packs the Integer into a String, for a specific architecture and
  # address-length.
  #
  # @param [Ronin::Arch] arch
  #   The architecture to pack the Integer for.
  #
  # @param [Integer] address_length
  #   The number of bytes to pack.
  #
  # @return [String]
  #   The packed Integer.
  #
  # @example
  #   0x41.pack(Arch.i686) # => "A\000\000\000"
  #
  # @example
  #   0x41.pack(Arch.ppc,2) # => "\000A"

  # @return [String]
  #   The hex escaped version of the Integer.
  #
  # @example
  #   42.hex_escape
  #   # => "\\x2a"
  #
  def hex_escape
    "\\x%.2x" % self
