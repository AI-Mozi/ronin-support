        # `@telnet_ssl` instance variables will also be used to connect
        # to the Telnet server.
        #
        # @param [Hash] options
        #   Additional options.
        #
        # @option options [Integer] :port (Ronin::Network::Telnet.default_port)

        #
        # @option options [String] :dump_log
        #   Similar to the `:output_log` option, but connection output
        #   is also written in hexdump format.
        #
        # @option options [Regexp] :prompt (Ronin::Network::Telnet.default_prompt)
        #   A regular expression matching the host command-line prompt
        #   sequence, used to determine when a command has finished.
        #
        # @option options [Boolean] :telnet (true)
        #   Indicates that the connection shall behave as a telnet
        #   connection.
        #
        # @option options [Boolean] :plain
        #   Indicates that the connection shall behave as a normal TCP
        #   connection.
        #
        # @option options [Integer] :timeout (Ronin::Network::Telnet.default_timeout)
        #   The number of seconds to wait before timing out both the
        #   initial attempt to connect to host, and all attempts to read
        #   data from the host.
        #
        # @option options [Integer] :wait_time
        #   The amount of time to wait after seeing what looks like
        #   a prompt.
        #
        # @option options [Net::Telnet, IO] :proxy (Ronin::Network::Telnet.proxy)
        #   A proxy object to used instead of opening a direct connection
        #   to the host.
        #
        # @option options [String] :user
        #   The user to login as.
        #
        # @option options [String] :password
        #   The password to login with.
        #
