## Description

Ronin Support is a support library for Ronin. Ronin Support contains many of
the convenience methods used by Ronin and additional libraries.

Ronin is a Ruby platform for exploit development and security research.
Ronin allows for the rapid development and distribution of code, exploits
or payloads over many common Source-Code-Management (SCM) systems.

### Ruby

Ronin's Ruby environment allows security researchers to leverage Ruby with
ease. The Ruby environment contains a multitude of convenience methods
for working with data in Ruby, a Ruby Object Database, a customized Ruby
Console and an extendable command-line interface.

### Extend

Ronin's more specialized features are provided by additional Ronin
libraries, which users can choose to install. These libraries can allow
one to write and run Exploits and Payloads, scan for PHP vulnerabilities,
perform Google Dorks  or run 3rd party scanners.

### Publish

Ronin allows users to publish and share code, exploits, payloads or other
data via Overlays. Overlays are directories of code and data that can be
hosted on any SVN, Hg, Git or Rsync server. Ronin makes it easy to create,
install or update Overlays.
